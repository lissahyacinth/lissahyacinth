I do machine learning in Rust, CUDA, Python, and R, with no order of preference. 

### I'm working on...
| Project 	| Language & Link 	|
|-	|-	|
| Neural Networks | [Rust](https://github.com/spearow/juice) 	|
| Gradient Boosted Forest  	| [Rust](https://gitlab.com/EdenHyacinth/randomforust) 	|
| Efficient Multiclass Partitioning | [Rust](https://gitlab.com/EdenHyacinth/partition_methods) |

If you want to contact me, email me! {repo_name}@gmail dot com - I'm down for collabs around ML in Rust.
